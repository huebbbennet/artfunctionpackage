## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,include=FALSE}
my_static_art <- function(x = 42){
  

  library(gganimate)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(gifski)
  library(png)
 
   set.seed(x)
  
  df = data.frame(A = sample(1:100, 40),
                  B=sample(1:100, 40),
                  C=sample(1:125, 40), 
                  D= sample(1:200, 40),
                  E= sample(1:200, 40), 
                  G=sample(1:200, 40), 
                  H=sample(1:200, 40),
                  I=sample(1:200, 40)) 
  return(ggplot(df, aes(A)) +
           geom_point(aes(y = B), color = "black", size = 10, shape = 0) +
           geom_point(aes(y = C), color = "red", size = 10, shape = 0) +
           geom_point(aes(y = D), color = "green", size = 10, shape = 0) +
           geom_point(aes(y = E), color = "blue", size = 10, shape = 0) +
           geom_point(aes(y = G), color = "purple", size = 10, shape = 0)+
           geom_point(aes(y = H), color = "orange", size = 10, shape = 0)+
           theme_void()+
           labs(y= "", x = "")+
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL)+
           scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL)+
           coord_polar()
  )
}
(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
my_static_art()

```

```{r}
my_static_art(32)

```

```{r}
my_static_art(2)

```

```{r}
my_static_art(102)

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
